## Description of activities

- Discussing experiences as mentees, mentors, and program organizers;
- Defining what a "good" open mentorship program is;
- Listening example of good open mentorship programs;
- Understanding different approaches to structure mentorships;
- Discussing pain points and mistakes made as program organizers;
- Deciding to write a handbook for **program organizers**!

## Output

- We decided to create a new handbook for program organizers to help them access shared communal knowledge.
- We decided to reactivate a past DISC Unconference 2023 guide — a mentorship guide for mentors participating in open projects.
- Our approach isn't one that subscribes to a specific way to create and manage open mentorship programs; instead, it offers the open community a point of reference of practices tested by generations of contributors, and it helps it navigate complexity.
